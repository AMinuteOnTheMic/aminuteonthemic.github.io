      <title>About A Minute on the Mic</title>

      <description>A Minute on the Mic is a curated video series where the curator (Laura Santamaria) takes a crowd-sourced question from Twitter, finds experts, and gives each expert a chance to answer the question in one minute in a recorded response. Then, all of those responses are compiled into a single video and released for everyone to watch.
In curating these videos, I hope that we can start getting a sense of how we collectively work, how we collectively think, and how we collectively can go do great things.</description>
